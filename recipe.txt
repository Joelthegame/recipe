Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of cling film or plastic wrap and pound them with a kitchen mallet or rolling pin until the chicken breasts are about half an inch thick.
 In a bowl, mix bread crumbs, oregano, garlic salt, salt and pepper. 
Dip the chicken in this mixture and coat all the sides evenly.
 In a large pan, heat olive oil on medium flame and place the chicken in the pan.
 Cook for about 8-10 minutes until the chicken turns brown on both sides and is no longer pink in the centre.
 Once done, place the cooked chicken breasts in a baking dish.
 In a saucepan, add tomatoes, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic salt, basil and oregano.
 Combine and cook on medium-low flame for about 10-15 minutes. 
Pour this sauce over the cooked chicken placed in the baking dish.
 Add pepperoni and mozzarella cheese on top.
 Bake for about 20-30 minutes until the cheese melts.
 Garnish the baked chicken with basil pesto or left-over sauce.
 Serve hot with pasta or rice.
